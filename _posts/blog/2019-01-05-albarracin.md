I am back to my blog finally after two years. This time I have a very interesting traveling experience with one of my close friends. It was the summer of 2016. Yes, I know it feels like a long time back. We had always dreamed of going for Tomatina in Valencia. However, we finally made a plan for a visit on 2016. Since Tomatina is on Wednesday, we had booked our vacation for five days. So, now began our adventure in Valencia.

In this blog, I will write only about my experiences in the beautiful and small city of Albarracin. Since we had four more days in Valencia, besides Tomatina, we decided to explore a city called Albarracin. 

Since we didn't go to Valencia by car or rent one, we were traveling by train. When we looked at the train schedules from Valencia to Albarracin, we found out that we could to go Cella first and book car from there which would take us roughly 30-45 minutes from Cella to Albarracin. So, in the morning at around 09:00 am, we started our journey from Valencia. 

When we reached Cella after around three hours, we were completely shocked at what we saw. Actually, we didn't see a single living soul there. And, guess what? We hadn't booked the taxi from Cella to Albarracin before we reached there. So, both of us had no idea about what we were going to do. We were just looking around at advertisements on the train station. Luckily, we saw a phone number for taxi and when we called it, he couldn't speak English and we couldn't speak Spanish, but somehow we managed to tell him that we wanted to go to Albarracin from Cella (thanks to google translator). He was a very nice man and also took us to Albarracin within a reasonable price (unfortunately, since it was a long time back, I don't remember exactly how much.) If you want to book his taxi from Cella to Albarracin, please find his contact in the image below.

When we reached Albarracin, we were so happy but we did not know what to expect. Usually when we travel, we just look some images and just go there. We decided to follow people and we were wandering around. It was such a lovely and small place. The rooftops were thatched roofs, which reminded me of my hometown, Kathmandu. We were hungry after walking for sometime, and found a restaurant nearby. It had amazing food.

After eating, we decided to again continue with our exploration. We saw that there was a wall on the top of the hill, so we just followed our instincts and decided to go on the top to the wall. I must say that, we were really unprepared for it, I was wearing sneakers and the friend of mine was wearing slippers. We reached at the top to the amazing view. This city was in the middle of nowhere, everywhere we looked, it was just hills. It was breathtaking.

After visiting this beautiful city it was time to return to Valencia, but our adventures were not finished. We called the same taxi that took us to Albarracin to go back to Cella. Later we learned, that only three or four trains from Valencia to Cella and the same vice versa. We realized that we were waiting for the last train in the middle of nowhere to Valencia. Luckily, we were two hours early to the train station but unluckily with nothing to do rather than make more photos of this nowhere place and look at clouds (I was seriously doing that). Furthermore, we did not have any idea in which platform the train was coming. So we decided that we will wait for the train in two different platforms and as the train comes near, we will go to the correct platform. You might think, that is crazy, but at that time that seemed like a good option. However, we did not have to do that, because the last train came from Valencia and we knew in which platform will our train arrive.

All in all, it was an adventurous trip with a very nice view and good memories.
