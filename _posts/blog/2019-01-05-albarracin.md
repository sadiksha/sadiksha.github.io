I am back to my blog finally after two years. This time I have a very interesting traveling experience with my traveling buddy. It was the summer of 2016. Yes, I know it feels like a long time back. We had always dreamed of going for Tomatina in Valencia. However, we finally made a plan for a visit on 2016. Since Tomatina is on Wednesday, we had booked our vacation for five days. So, now began our adventure in Valencia.

In this blog, I will write only about my experiences in the beautiful and small city of Albarracin. Since we had four more days in Valencia, besides Tomatina, we decided to explore a city called Albarracin. 

Since we didn't go to Valencia by car or rent one, we were traveling by train. When we looked at the train schedules from Valencia to Albarracin, we found out that we could to go Cella first and book car from there which would take us roughly 30-45 minutes from Cella to Albarracin. So, in the morning at around 09:00 am, we started our journey from Valencia. 

When we reached Cella after around three hours, we were completely shocked at what we saw. Actually, we didn't see a single living soul there. And, guess what? We hadn't booked the taxi from Cella to Albarracin before we reached there. So, both of us had no idea about what we were going to do. Luckily, the friend of mine had a taxi app and she called one. But, the person from the taxi told us that we would have to travel with four other people and some kids. That sounded a bit strange. So, we decided that we would look for another taxi. We were just looking around at advertisements on the train station. Luckily, we saw a phone number for taxi and when we called it, he couldn't speak English and we couldn't speak Spanish, but somehow we managed to tell him that we wanted to go to Albarracin from Cella (thanks to google translator). He was a very nice man and also took us to Albarracin within a reasonable price (unfortunately, since it was a long time back, I don't remember exactly how much.) If you want to book his taxi from Cella to Albarracin, please find his contact details on this blog.
