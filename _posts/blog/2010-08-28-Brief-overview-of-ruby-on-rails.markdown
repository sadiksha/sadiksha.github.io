 I still remember when we had to do our final year project, we had to write tons of code for building small application in programming languages other than on rails. However, Rails has saved the life of many programmers! In rails, we do not have to start from the scratch like making folders and files one by one. This is done by the rails itself. Write a simple rails command and all the required folders are generated. Isn't it awesome. Rails is the platform and Ruby is the programming language. The life of Ruby programmer is made easy through RubyGems, which contains files to install. They are like plugins, for example, if you want user authentication you can simply install gem called devise(I will come to this later on).

Moreover, Rails is based on MVC(Model, View and Controller) architecture. Models deals with data and database. View is what your user-interface will look like. Finally, controller connects the model and view. It's the job of the controller to control both the model and the view.

You will find many useful materials on internet but I could not stop myself from this brief introduction to "Ruby on the Rails". Finally, welcome to the "Rails World" (apart from "Hello World" ;) ).
