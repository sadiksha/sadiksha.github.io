It is really very easy to create a first ruby program. Follow the following instructions:

* Create a file called my\_first\_ruby\_program.rb

{% highlight text %}
touch my_first_ruby_program.rb
{% endhighlight %}

* Add following to your file

{% highlight ruby %}
puts "Rails World"
{% endhighlight %}

* In the terminal:

{% highlight text %}
 ruby my_first_ruby_program.rb
{% endhighlight %}


You will see 'Rails World' as the output. Congratulations you just created your first ruby program.
